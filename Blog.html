												<h3>To hear from me</h3>
												<p> No matter what you do, NYC will be an adventure. Although the city entails a lot of walking, New York is a hub of energy and positives vibes. To take a break from the busy city, Brooklyn is just a bridge over and has its own charm. I personally believe that SOHO has the best shops and is a very good place to take pictures. If you haven't been to NY, check out Times Square, but it's not necessary to keep on revisiting since its shops stay the same for the most part. The High Line is one of my favorite "walking trails" and has many pieces of artwork along the way. After walking the high line, the Doughnuttery at Chelsea Market is a must. In addition, Jack's Wife Freda has wonderful breakfast and there will most likely be a line to get in, but it moves quickly. All the food at the restaurants listed can definitely make it on your snapchat story. I believe that visiting NYC is great at any time of year as well. However, if you happen to be there in the winter, walk to Rockefeller Center and maybe get your skate on!
